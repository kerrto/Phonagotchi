Written in Objective-C, Phonagotchi allows users to interact with a cat image.

Users can: 

Pet the cat: they can stroke the cat image with one finger; if they stroke it too fast, the cat with get angry.

Feed the cat: they can pich the basket next to the cat for an apple to appear. 
              They can drag the apple onto the image for the cat to "eat" the apple.
              If the cat is angry, the cat will get "happy" by giving it an apple.
              If you take the apple too far from the cat, the cat will become angry and the apple will fall off the screen.

This was an assignment.
